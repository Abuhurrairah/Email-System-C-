# Email-System-C-
The purpose is to simulate a basic email client that can:  
Load saved emails from a file at startup  
Add new emails into Inbox or Outbox  
Display emails in Inbox/Outbox  
Search emails by keyword  
Detect spam using simple keyword matching  
Prioritize/sort emails based on a priority number  
Save everything back to the file so data persists
